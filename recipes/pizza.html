    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>In large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add oil and salt. Stir in
                flour, 1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 2-3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl,
                turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. </p>

            <p>Punch down dough; divide in half. Press each half into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Combine the tomato
                sauce, oregano and basil; spread over each crust. If desired, add toppings of your choice. Sprinkle with
                cheese. </p>

            <p>Bake at 400Â° for 25-30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.</p>
