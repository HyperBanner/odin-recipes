# odin-recipes
First Project for TOP.

This was relatively easy. I just needed to find a good source for the recipes because I can't cook to save my life.
All credit goes for the recipes goes to [Taste of Home](www.tasteofhome.com), check out more of their stuff if you can!

Now, truth be told, this is my second time doing this project because I stopped doing TOP a while ago and definitely forgot how to do most things, so I decided to redo
everything from scratch. So far so good, I definitely remembered the HTML stuff way better than I initially thought.
